    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../img/pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza">
    <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>        
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni, or as desired</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced black olives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, olive oil, salt, and the yeast mixture. Using a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, knead until a smooth, elastic dough forms, about 8 minutes. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Punch down dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a round shape. Transfer to a pizza pan sprinkled with cornmeal.</li>
        <li>Spoon pizza sauce over dough and top with mozzarella cheese. Add desired toppings and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and golden, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
